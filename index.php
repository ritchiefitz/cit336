	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I was born in Grand Junction, Colorado, and raised in Moab, UT and Rexburg, ID. Since I was a kid 
		there have been three areas of interest I have always had, science, math, and music. When I was 
		in elementary school I auditioned and became a part of Rexburg Boy’s Choir. That was a great 
		experience for me. Since I was young I have always loved to play sports. I played every sport 
		except soccer. When I was younger I was more into baseball and then it faded into Basketball. 
		I have always loved watching football, but I didn’t like playing it as much as the others.

		For a small time I attended Idaho Leadership Academy. It was really fun and interesting for the year and 
		a half that I did it. We learned and studied a lot of classical works. We read classical books, and 
		studied Euclid, and we were able to learn about a lot of the great leaders of the world. At the end 
		of the first year I was chosen as the schools valedictorian. That was a great honor. After this 
		though I missed the social scene of public school and everything it had to offer for different 
		activities and groups.

	<h2>Computer Science History</h2>
	<p>
		I started getting interested in Computer Science when I was about 12 years old. My cousin, 
		Richard, and I started making games with GameMaker. It was a lot of fun as a kid, and I enjoyed 
		watching others play the games I made. Since then my passion for learning more about computers 
		has increased exponentially. I didn’t really do much more than that since I was a kid till college.
	</p>
	<p>
		At college I was trying to decide what to major in because I had a lot of different interests. 
		Computers stuck out to me, and I decided to give it a try. My first class was the hardest. My 
		class at first had 30-40 kids in it, but in the end it ended up being around 5-8. I learned a 
		lot, but I really fell in love with it in my second class. After that I decided that that is 
		what I needed to do. I now am getting my major in Computer Information Technologies and my minor 
		n Computer Science. My first internship was with Barton Consulting, they build websites, it was 
		fun to get into that realm more and now I can easily build a websites using many different tools. 
		I also worked for AMD as a computer scientist, building a python GUI program to help them 
		validate certain things. It was an awesome project and I was able to learn a lot.
	</p>
	<p>
		Along the way I have been using and teaching myself many different languages, and I haven’t used 
		all of these in building projects but I have used all of them in coding before.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>HTML5</li>
		<li>CSS3</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>jQuery</li>
		<li>PHP</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Ruby</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The ones I have built real programs for have been Java, HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, 
		python and ruby. I have learned all I know though with C++. Learning C++ was helpful because I 
		know what is going on more behind the scenes with these other languages. To see more what I have 
		done look at my portfolio page and resume for a detailed work history and you could even take a 
		look at my linkedin page.
